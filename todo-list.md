# Domain Tracker - Local Optimization Todo List
##
- add domain grouping
    defining a custom property limited by 256 alphanumeric (example: to transfer or on account 1
showing list of properties added/to select from below the table and in additional column next to domain
    select domain by clicking on it
    assign a property

## Bulk Domain Operations
- [ ] Add bulk import functionality for domain lists
- [ ] Create bulk export feature with date stamps
- [ ] Add progress indicator for bulk operations

## Interface Improvements
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality
- [ ] Implement domain grouping/categorization
- [ ] Add export format options (JSON, CSV, XML)

## Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Add graceful degradation for DNS failures
- [ ] Add network connectivity check
- [ ] Create error recovery suggestions

## Security (Keep Current - Adequate for Local Use)

### Already Implemented
- [x] Domain validation with RFC compliance
- [x] Input sanitization for domain names
- [x] Record type whitelisting
- [x] DNS server IP validation
- [x] Error logging for debugging

## Low Priority (Polish & Optional)

### 8. Security Enhancements (Optional for Local Use)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for rapid refreshes (optional)
- [ ] Add data integrity checks for JSON files
- [ ] Simplify validation for local-only use

### 9. Code Optimizations
- [ ] Simplify error handling for local development
- [ ] Add basic whitelist validation for record types
- [ ] Implement timeout commands for shell queries

## Success Metrics

- [ ] DNS queries complete in under 3 seconds
- [ ] Cache reduces redundant queries by 70%
- [ ] Bulk import handles 100+ domains efficiently
- [ ] Debug logs help troubleshoot DNS issues
- [ ] Auto-refresh works reliably for monitoring

## Notes

- **Current Grade**: A- for local use
- **Focus Area**: Performance and usability over security
- **Architecture**: Keep single-file simplicity
- **Storage**: JSON files are appropriate for local use
- **Deployment**: No external dependencies needed
